# Vue WordPress Components

Vue WordPress components is a simple, lightweight Vue.js UI Toolkit that integrates with the WordPress dashboard to build admin pages. 

This is an opinionanted set of components that I use in the majority of my WordPress projects, therefore it made sense to merge the components into a library.

## Installation

Install Vue WordPress Components through npm or yarn

```
```

Import or require Vue and Vue WordPress components in your code:

```
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueWPComponents from 'vue-wordpress-components'
import 'vue-wordpress-components/dist/vue-wordpress-components.min.css'

Vue.use(VueWPComponents)
```
